## Description

## Usage
AS AN avid reader I WANT to search for new books to read SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase.
  
GIVEN a book search engine

WHEN I click on the Search for Books menu option  
THEN I am presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button  
  
WHEN I am not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button  
THEN I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site  
  
WHEN I click on the Login/Signup menu option  
THEN a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up
